								<h2>Experience in Programming</h2>
								<p>My life as a programmer began in Bellarmine's Summer School the summer before my freshman year at Bellarmine. 
								I took a class called Exploring Computer Science 1, which taught the basics of computers as well as HTML and CSS.
								It was a very fun class for me, becuase even though it wasn't the most advanced or useful, it was good to gain a 
								basic understanding of how to write code. My second semester of my Freshman year at Bellarmine, I took ECS 2, which
								was based on Python. This class was much more useful and productive, because Python is a very good programming language
								for beginners. It was the first time that I had experience in true programming. My sophomore year, I took AP Computer
								Science A, which is entirely based in Java. This is by far the most useful class I have taken in Computer Science. 
								Because it was a year-long course, we were able to go further in depth, learning more advanced areas of Java, at 
								least for the high school level. I also got a 5 on the AP test. In my current junior year, I am taking a class 
								called Advanced Computer Science: Data Structures. The course was designed to be a follow-up course to APCS, so
								it is still based in Java. It focuses on different data structures (which could be implemented in any language)
								such as binary trees and heaps, most recently. The most important thing I have taken away from my two years of 
								experience in Java is that the key is understanding algorithms and the basics of Computer Science as an abstract 
								concept. As long as you know how to solve the problems presented in the tech world, the language used to solve them
								is not the difficult part, as long as you have an understand of fundamental computer science. Outside of what I have
								learned at Bellarmine, I have used resources online such as <a href="http://codecademy.com">Code Academy</a> and
								<a href="http://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a> to continue learning about programming and coding. </p>
