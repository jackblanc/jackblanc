							<h2>A Cross Country Runner</h2>

								<h2>Cross Country</h2>
								<p>Let me preface this by saying that I was never a runner. My freshman year at Bellarmine, a friend
								texted me the night before the sign-ups for Cross Country and told me to join it with him. I immediately
								laughed off the idea, but I still went to the meeting. I signed up at the end of the meeting, and that
								began my life as a runner. At the first time trial, I was the slowest person on the team. Literally.
								Dead last. I ran a 10:19 in the mile time trial. By the end of the season, I ran around a nine minute 
								mile. Not much improvement, but a good start. The next year I decided to continue with Cross Country,
								and that friend who got me into this mess did not. I started the season with around a nine minute mile
								and finished at 7:06 Good improvement, but not where I wanted to be. Towards the end of my sophomore 
								year, I started focusing a lot on nutrition, which exponentially helpedd me in all areas of my life.
								I lost about twenty pounds before the next season of XC started in the fall, which allowed my 
								junior season to be the best few months of physical training I ever had. I started at a 7:09 mile
								and finished at a 5:52. Getting my mile time under six minutes was one of the best feelings I ever had. 
								On top of that, in our races, all of which are around three miles, I averaged an improvement of around 
								five minutes, which was monumental for me. At the end of the season banquet, I was awarded "Most Improved"
								by my coaches, which I appreciated very much. I felt like my work had paid off. More importantly, I had
								my friends with me along the way, creating a group of interdependence that really helped our team prosper. 
								I'm not sure why I'm writing this, but I felt like I need to share my story. If you commit to something and 
								stick with it, you can truly succeed. Now, I <b>am</b> a runner, for many reasons. Of course it is great 
								cardiovascular training. But I also like running because it is a time of reflection. I am often very busy
								and preoccupied with homework and projects, but when I am running I have time to think and reflect about 
								my life and the bigger picture.
