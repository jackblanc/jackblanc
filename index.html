								<h2>About me:</h2>
								<p>My name is Jack Blanc, and this is who I am. I am a junior at Bellarmine College 
								Prep, a Jesuit college preparatory school in San Jose, California. I am a programmer,
								with experience in Java and Python, as well as coding experience in HTML/CSS. In a year 
								and a half I will be beginning my college experience <i>somewhere</i>, hopefully pursuing 
								a degree in Computer Science as well as a degree in Entrepreneurship or Business Administration. 
								I have interest in these areas of study because I believe there is much potential in combining 
								these programs. By applying a knowledge of Computer Science to the business world, opportunities 
								arise for the creation of products or services which can change the world. In my current life,
								I run cross country and play rugby, as well as participating in various on-campus clubs. More 
								information about everything can be found below. Overall, I am a motivateed high-schooler with grand 
								aspirations and a determination to succeed in an area that I am passionate about.

								<h2>Experience in Programming</h2>
								<p>At Bellarmine, I have taken four courses involving Computer Science. Combined, they have provided me with knowledge
								in HTML, CSS, Python, and especially Java. After I complete this spring semester, I will have two full years of honors and AP-level
								programming in Java. Outside of school, I have continued my education online, using the tremendous resource that is the internet
								to learn more every day. </p>

								<h2>Cross Country</h2>
								<p>Let me preface this by saying that I was never a runner. My freshman year at Bellarmine, a friend
								texted me the night before the sign-ups for Cross Country and told me to join it with him. I immediately
								laughed off the idea, but I still went to the meeting. I signed up at the end of the meeting, and that
								began my life as a runner. At the first time trial, I was the slowest person on the team. Literally.
								Dead last. I ran a 10:19 in the mile time trial. By the end of the season, I ran around a nine minute 
								mile. Not much improvement, but a good start. The next year I decided to continue with Cross Country,
								and that friend who got me into this mess did not. I started the season with around a nine minute mile
								and finished at 7:06 Good improvement, but not where I wanted to be. Towards the end of my sophomore 
								year, I started focusing a lot on nutrition, which exponentially helpedd me in all areas of my life.
								I lost about twenty pounds before the next season of XC started in the fall, which allowed my 
								junior season to be the best few months of physical training I ever had. I started at a 7:09 mile
								and finished at a 5:52. Getting my mile time under six minutes was one of the best feelings I ever had. 
								On top of that, in our races, all of which are around three miles, I averaged an improvement of around 
								five minutes, which was monumental for me. At the end of the season banquet, I was awarded "Most Improved"
								by my coaches, which I appreciated very much. I felt like my work had paid off. More importantly, I had
								my friends with me along the way, creating a group of interdependence that really helped our team prosper. 
								I'm not sure why I'm writing this, but I felt like I need to share my story. If you commit to something and 
								stick with it, you can truly succeed. Now, I <b>am</b> a runner, for many reasons. Of course it is great 
								cardiovascular training. But I also like running because it is a time of reflection. I am often very busy
								and preoccupied with homework and projects, but when I am running I have time to think and reflect about 
								my life and the bigger picture.

								<h2>Rugby</h2>
								<p>
								Also in my freshman year, I joined Bellarmine's club rugby team. How did I get into that mess?
								As an eigth grader, I went to an open house at Bell, and as we walked by the rugby table, the coach 
								recognized my mom, who he knew from when she was a kid. He looked at me and told me that I looked
								like a rugby player and was going to play for him at Bell, so I took his advice and joined for the
								January season of my freshman year. Thankfully, about half the team had never played before, so I 
								wasn't alone in my lack of any experience. I played flanker and lock, and ended up liking the sport.
								I was friends with many people on the team, so that made it even more fun playing with them. The game
								itself is very mentally challenging. It takes a lot of determination and strength, both mentally and physically, 
								which has given me skills I have applied to all walks of my life.
