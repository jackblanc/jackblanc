								<h2>About me:</h2>
								<p>My name is Jack Blanc, and this website is an introduction to who I am. 
								I am a junior at Bellarmine College Prep, a rigorous Jesuit college preparatory school in San Jose, California. 
								I am a programmer, with extensive experience in Java. I also have a decent amount of experience in Python and HTML/CSS.
								In a year and a half I will be beginning the next chapter of my life as a college student. I hope to pursue 
								a major in Computer Science as well as possibly a major or minor in Entrepreneurship or Business Administration. 
								These are the two areas which interest me most as of now because I believe there is much potential for success
								in the combination of the technology and business worlds. In my current life as a high school student, 
								I run cross country and play rugby, as well as leading and participating in various clubs at school.
								</br></br>I am a motivated student with grand aspirations and a determination to succeed in an area that I am passionate about.

								<h2>Experience in Programming</h2>
								<p>My life as a programmer began in Bellarmine's Summer School the summer before my freshman year at Bellarmine. 
								I took a class called Exploring Computer Science 1, which taught the basics of computers as well as HTML and CSS.
								It was a very fun class for me, becuase even though it wasn't the most advanced or useful, it was good to gain a 
								basic understanding of how to write code. My second semester of my Freshman year at Bellarmine, I took ECS 2, which
								was based on Python. This class was much more useful and productive, because Python is a very good programming language
								for beginners. It was the first time that I had experience in true programming. My sophomore year, I took AP Computer
								Science A, which is entirely based in Java. This is by far the most useful class I have taken in Computer Science. 
								Because it was a year-long course, we were able to go further in depth, learning more advanced areas of Java, at 
								least for the high school level. I also got a 5 on the AP test. In my current junior year, I am taking a class 
								called Advanced Computer Science: Data Structures. The course was designed to be a follow-up course to APCS, so
								it is still based in Java. It focuses on different data structures (which could be implemented in any language)
								such as binary trees and heaps, most recently. The most important thing I have taken away from my two years of 
								experience in Java is that the key is understanding algorithms and the basics of Computer Science as an abstract 
								concept. As long as you know how to solve the problems presented in the tech world, the language used to solve them
								is not the difficult part, as long as you have an understand of fundamental computer science. Outside of what I have
								learned at Bellarmine, I have used resources online such as <a href="http://codecademy.com">Code Academy</a> and
								<a href="http://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a> to continue learning about programming and coding. </p>

								<h2>Cross Country</h2>
								<p>Let me preface this by saying that I was never a runner. My freshman year at Bellarmine, a friend
								texted me the night before the sign-ups for Cross Country and told me to join it with him. I immediately
								laughed off the idea, but I still went to the meeting. I signed up at the end of the meeting, and that
								began my life as a runner. At the first time trial, I was the slowest person on the team. Literally.
								Dead last. I ran a 10:19 in the mile time trial. By the end of the season, I ran around a nine minute 
								mile. Not much improvement, but a good start. The next year I decided to continue with Cross Country,
								and that friend who got me into this mess did not. I started the season with around a nine minute mile
								and finished at 7:06 Good improvement, but not where I wanted to be. Towards the end of my sophomore 
								year, I started focusing a lot on nutrition, which exponentially helpedd me in all areas of my life.
								I lost about twenty pounds before the next season of XC started in the fall, which allowed my 
								junior season to be the best few months of physical training I ever had. I started at a 7:09 mile
								and finished at a 5:52. Getting my mile time under six minutes was one of the best feelings I ever had. 
								On top of that, in our races, all of which are around three miles, I averaged an improvement of around 
								five minutes, which was monumental for me. At the end of the season banquet, I was awarded "Most Improved"
								by my coaches, which I appreciated very much. I felt like my work had paid off. More importantly, I had
								my friends with me along the way, creating a group of interdependence that really helped our team prosper. 
								I'm not sure why I'm writing this, but I felt like I need to share my story. If you commit to something and 
								stick with it, you can truly succeed. Now, I <b>am</b> a runner, for many reasons. Of course it is great 
								cardiovascular training. But I also like running because it is a time of reflection. I am often very busy
								and preoccupied with homework and projects, but when I am running I have time to think and reflect about 
								my life and the bigger picture.

								<h2>Rugby</h2>
								<p>
								Also in my freshman year, I joined Bellarmine's club rugby team. An old friend of my grandmother is the coach,
								so he reccomended that I play rugby, and I decided to take his advice. I had never played any rugby before in my life. 
								Thankfully, about half the team had never played before as well, so I 
								wasn't alone in my lack of any experience. I learned to play flanker and lock, and ended up actually enjoying the sport.
								I became friends with many people on the team, so that made it even more fun to play with them. The game
								itself is very mentally challenging. It takes a lot of determination and strength, both mentally and physically, 
								which has given me skills I have applied to all walks of my life.

								<h2>Clubs</h2>
								<p>Below are some clubs or activities I lead or have participated in: </p>
							</header>
							<ul class="features">
								<li class="icon fa-laptop">
									<h3>Career Advancement and Professional Development Society</h3>
									<p>The CAPDS is a club which I am a member of at Bellarmine, and I find it is one of the most useful and productive clubs 
									which I participate in. In the club, we discuss everything from building a resume and LinkedIn profile to internships. 
									The main goal of the club is to give students a head start on their professional careers, by beginning the networking 
									and resume-building process early. </p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-paper-plane-o">
									<h3>Bellarmine Blending Club</h3>
									<p>I am the vice president of the Bellarmine Blending Club, which meets bi-weekly to create delicious smoothies or
									milkshakes. Each meeting has a different theme, varying from tropical smoothies to protein shakes. We also created 
									t-shirts, and sold 23 of them to members. Though the club itself is not very serious or professional, I have gained
									leadership skills in the club which I will have for the rest of my life. </p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-heart-o">
									<h3>Kino Club</h3>
									<p>I am the secretary of the Bellarmine branch of the national Kino Club association. The Kino Border Initiative is a group which works
									with people who have been deported, protecting them from the cartels and gangs on their journeys near the border. 
									The mission of our individual club is to raise awareness among students, which we are trying to do by creating a series of 
									flyers/posters that go with short videos, each of which tells the different story of a migrant. Our motto is "Humanity has no borders",
									because we believe in treating all people with respect, regardless of their background. </p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-paper-plane-o">
									<h3>Coffee Club</h3>
									<p>I am the secretary of the Bellarmine Coffe Club, which meets weekly to consume coffee. The club is a great break from the 
									high-paced lifestyle of the Bellarmine student, which is good. Also, coffee is beneficial to the human body in a tremendous
									amount of ways, so that is just an added benefit. </p>
