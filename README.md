# Hi, I'm Jack ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m studying Computer Science at Northeastern, graduating Spring 2022. I previously worked as a Software Engineer Co-op at Teikametrics, a startup building the future of E-Commerce optimization, where I had the opportunity to work full-stack in React, Typescript, Scala, Python, and Ruby on Rails. Prior to that, I worked at Wayfair, where I built a full-stack UI/UX using React, Javascript, GraphQL and PHP. Iâ€™m passionate about engineering management and using my skills to help others and give back, which led me to create Code4Community, a student-led group at Northeastern. Currently, Iâ€™m seeking Summer and Fall 2021 internship or co-op opportunities. Please send me an email (jackblanc@hey.com), Iâ€™d love to connect with you!
