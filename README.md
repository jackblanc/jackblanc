# Hi, I'm Jack ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m studying Computer Science at Northeastern, graduating Spring 2022. Currently, Iâ€™m a Software Engineer Co-op at Teikametrics, a startup building the future of E-Commerce optimization, where Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to work full-stack in React, Typescript, Scala, Ruby on Rails, and Python. Iâ€™m passionate about engineering management and using my skills to help others and give back, which led me to create Code4Community, a student-led group at Northeastern. Currently, Iâ€™m seeking Summer and Fall 2021 internship or co-op opportunities. Please send me an email (blanc.ja@northeastern.edu), Iâ€™d love to connect with you!
